# WorkerContract

This project serves as a practice exercise to revise Java programming concepts. It involves creating a simple application to manage workers' contracts and calculate their income based on hours worked. The application allows users to input data such as department name, worker details, contract dates, and hourly rates. It then calculates the total income for a specific month and year. Overall, this project is a hands-on opportunity to reinforce Java skills, covering topics like object-oriented programming, enums, exception handling, input/output, and formatting.
